\title{Run multiple FAC models to equilibirum accross a range of parameters}
\usage{
runFAC_multi(param.grid = param_grid(), Ninit = c(10, 0, 10, 0),
  remakeFigure = NA, use.IBM = F, verbose = F, eq.tol = 6, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{param.grid}{Dataframe of parameters, usually with 1 or 2 that vary accross a range}

\item{Ninit}{vector of initial population sizes}

\item{remakeFigure}{deprecated.  Replaced by plot_Fig29_3}

\item{use.IBM}{Use individual-based model (IBM) implementation}

\item{verbose}{Use verbose output}

\item{eq.tol}{Tolerance level for testing for equilibirum.  Smaller values are more stringent.}

\item{...}{other arguements}
}
\description{
Note that the "para.grid" arguement take take produced by the param_grid() function,
which gets its name because it uses the expand.grid() function to make all
combinations of the parameters being varied.
runFAC() has been updated to be able to output the full time serie
OR just the eq pop size
need to update runFAC_multi() to just take that eq size
should run a bit faster if runFAC() is keep all of that info
NB: "remakeFigure" does not appear in current code
}
